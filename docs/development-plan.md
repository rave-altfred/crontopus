# ðŸ¦‘ Crontopus Development Plan

## Project Status

**Current State**: Early scaffolding phase  
**Architecture**: Monorepo with 5 independent components  
**Implementation**: File structure created, awaiting core implementation

---

## Development Philosophy

**API-First Approach**: Build and test backend endpoints before implementing UI or CLI features.

**Iterative Development**: Deliver working features incrementally rather than building all components in parallel.

**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests alongside implementation, integration tests after core features are complete.

## Development Guidelines

### Component Order
1. **Backend first**: Always implement and test API endpoints before UI
2. **CLI second**: Build CLI commands after API is stable
3. **Frontend last**: Build web UI after CLI validates the API design

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Minimum 80% code coverage target

### Code Review Checkpoints
- API design review before implementation
- Security review for authentication/authorization changes
- Performance review for database queries
- UI/UX review for frontend changes

### Documentation Requirements
- API endpoints documented in OpenAPI spec
- CLI commands documented with examples
- Architecture decisions recorded in `docs/`
- Setup instructions for new developers
