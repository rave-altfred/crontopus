# 🦑 Crontopus Development Plan

## Project Status

**Current State**: Phase 1 (Foundation) - GitOps Architecture
**Architecture**: Monorepo with 5 independent components  
**Implementation**: Backend authentication complete, pivoting to GitOps for job definitions

---

## Development Philosophy

**GitOps-First**: Job definitions live in Git (Forgejo), not in database. Database stores only runtime data (run history, metrics, alerts).

**API-First Approach**: Build and test backend endpoints before implementing UI or CLI features.

**Iterative Development**: Deliver working features incrementally rather than building all components in parallel.

**Testing Strategy**: Unit tests alongside implementation, integration tests after core features are complete.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Backend (MVP)

### 1.1 Backend Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Set up FastAPI project structure and dependencies (`requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`)
- [x] Configure database connection (PostgreSQL recommended for multi-tenancy)
- [x] Implement configuration management (`backend/crontopus_api/config.py`)
- [x] Set up Alembic for database migrations
- [x] Create base models for multi-tenancy support

**Deliverable**: ✅ Backend can start, connect to database, and serve health check endpoint

### 1.2 Authentication & Multi-Tenancy
- [x] Implement tenant model and isolation strategy
- [x] Build authentication system (`backend/crontopus_api/security/`)
- [x] Create user management endpoints
- [x] Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Add tenant context middleware for all requests (deferred to Phase 1.3)

**Deliverable**: ✅ Users can register, authenticate, and access tenant-scoped resources

### 1.3 GitOps Job Definition System
- [x] ~~Design and implement job schema/model~~ (REMOVED - jobs live in Git)
- [x] ~~Build CRUD endpoints for jobs~~ (REMOVED - jobs live in Git)
- [x] Add job validation logic (cron expression validator - KEPT for agent use)
- [x] Design YAML job manifest schema for Git repository
- [x] Create example job manifests in Git
- [x] Document job manifest structure

**Deliverable**: ✅ Job manifest specification complete with examples

**Note**: Job definitions are YAML files in Git. See `docs/job-manifest-spec.md` and `examples/job-manifests/`

### 1.4 Job Run History & Check-in System
- [x] Design JobRun data model (job_name, tenant_id, status, output, timing)
- [x] Build check-in endpoint:
  - `POST /api/checkins` - Report job execution result (with job identifier from Git)
- [ ] Implement anonymous check-in via secret tokens (job-specific secrets - deferred to Phase 3)
- [x] Store run history with timestamps and outcomes
- [x] Build endpoint to retrieve run history:
  - `GET /api/runs` - List all runs (tenant-scoped)
  - `GET /api/runs/{job_name}` - Get runs for specific job
- [x] Create comprehensive tests for check-in and run history

**Deliverable**: ✅ Jobs can report execution results; run history is tracked in database

**Note**: Check-ins reference job by name/identifier (from Git manifest), not database ID. Secret token authentication will be added when agent is implemented.

---

## Phase 2: Basic CLI & Testing

### 2.1 CLI Foundation
- [x] Set up Python CLI project (`cli/pyproject.toml`)
- [x] Implement `core/api_client.py` - HTTP client wrapper

- [x] Implement authentication commands (`login`, `logout`, `whoami`)
- [x] Test CLI authentication flow

**Deliverable**: ✅ CLI can authenticate and communicate with backend

### 2.2 Job & Run Management Commands

- [x] `crontopus runs list` - Show run history with pagination and filtering
- [x] `crontopus runs show <run_id>` - Show detailed run information
- [ ] `crontopus agents list` - List enrolled agents (deferred to Phase 3)

**Deliverable**: ✅ Developers can view job run history via CLI

**Note**: Job creation/editing happens via Git commits, not CLI commands. Job/agent commands deferred until Phase 3 when those components exist.

### 2.3 Testing Infrastructure
- [x] Set up pytest for backend with conftest.py
- [x] Create shared test fixtures (db, client, test_user, test_tenant, auth_headers)

- [x] Integrate into agent main loop with graceful shutdown

**Deliverable**: ✅ Agent continuously syncs from Git and reconciles OS scheduler state

**Note**: Agent pulls job definitions from Git, NOT from backend API

### 3.4 Agent Backend Integration
- [x] Build agent management API in backend:
  - `POST /api/agents/enroll` - Enroll new agent
  - `GET /api/agents` - List enrolled agents
  - `GET /api/agents/{id}` - Get agent details
  - `DELETE /api/agents/{id}` - Revoke agent

- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Minimum 80% code coverage target

### Code Review Checkpoints
- API design review before implementation
- Security review for authentication/authorization changes
- Performance review for database queries
- UI/UX review for frontend changes

### Documentation Requirements
- API endpoints documented in OpenAPI spec
- CLI commands documented with examples
- Architecture decisions recorded in `docs/`
- Setup instructions for new developers
